{"name":"Hula-web","tagline":"Web application framework for Java using Hula-lang","body":"# Hula-web\r\n\r\nHula-web is a web application framework for Java based on the [Hula Scripting Language](https://github.com/simoncurd/hula-lang). It was designed to simplify and accelerate  development of web applications.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\n\r\n* Simplicity - The simplicity of the Hula language makes developing and maintaining web applications easy.\r\n* Suitability - Hula-based scripts are well suited to request-based interactions of web applications.\r\n* Separation - Hula introduces a clear separation between service and application layers of an application.\r\n\r\n# Principles\r\n\r\nHula-web applications are composed of Scripts & Pages.\r\n\r\n* Scripts - controls the request, reading request parameters, calling services, handling the session and specifying page flow.\r\n* Pages - Velocity templates which are used to render the view.\r\n\r\nThe Hula Web framework relates well to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm, in that Scripts behave as the Controller, Pages provide the Views and the object graphs of incoming requests and service interactions are the Model.\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\n\r\nA war file is provided in the /release folder which can be dropped straight into Tomcat. This deploys to the /hula context.\r\n\r\nOnce deployed:\r\n* The homepage for hula can be reached at [http://localhost:8080/hula/welcome](http://localhost:8080/hula/welcome) (Assuming out-the-box Tomcat configuration).\r\n\r\n# Latest Version\r\n\r\n* This is a very early release and is not considered production-ready.\r\n* The current release is version 0.1.1\r\n\r\n# Roadmap\r\n\r\nKey Features for future versions:\r\n\r\n* HttpUnit-based tests\r\n* Validation framework\r\n* Improved web-service support\r\n* SEO URL support\r\n\r\n# Contributing\r\n\r\n* Please raise any issues in the github issue tracker\r\n\r\n# Author\r\n\r\n* http://github.com/simoncurd\r\n\r\n# Copyright and License\r\n\r\n[Apache 2 License]\r\n\r\nCopyright 2013 Simon Curd simoncurd@gmail.com\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
